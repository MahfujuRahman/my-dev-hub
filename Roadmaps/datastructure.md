### Practice  
- Implement all types from scratch  
- Solve problems like removing duplicates, finding middle element

---

## Phase 3: Stacks and Queues (Weeks 5-6)

### Topics  
- Stack: LIFO principle, array & linked list implementation  
- Common operations and applications (expression evaluation, undo feature)  
- Queue: FIFO principle, simple queue, circular queue  
- Priority Queue / Heap basics

### Practice  
- Implement stack and queue  
- Solve balanced parentheses, next greater element, sliding window problems

---

## Phase 4: Trees (Weeks 7-10)

### Topics  
- Basic tree terminology (nodes, root, leaves, height, depth)  
- Binary Trees: traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)  
- Binary Search Trees (BST): insertion, deletion, search  
- Balanced Trees overview (AVL, Red-Black Trees - concept)  
- Tree problems: Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), diameter, subtree checks

### Practice  
- Implement BST and traversals  
- Solve problems related to tree traversals, BST property validation

---

## Phase 5: Hashing & Hash Tables (Weeks 11-12)

### Topics  
- Hash function and collision handling (chaining, open addressing)  
- Implement hash tables using arrays and linked lists  
- Applications: frequency counting, duplicate detection, anagrams

### Practice  
- Implement a simple hash map  
- Solve problems like two-sum, group anagrams

---

## Phase 6: Graphs (Weeks 13-16)

### Topics  
- Graph basics: terminology (vertices, edges, directed/undirected)  
- Graph representation: adjacency matrix, adjacency list  
- Graph traversal: Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS)  
- Detect cycles in graphs  
- Graph applications (connected components, bipartite check)

### Practice  
- Implement graph representations and traversals  
- Solve problems involving traversal and cycle detection

---

## Phase 7: Advanced Trees & Segment Trees (Weeks 17-18)

### Topics  
- Trie (Prefix Tree) basics and use cases (autocomplete, dictionary)  
- Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees) introduction  
- Range queries and updates  

### Practice  
- Implement trie and segment tree basics  
- Solve string prefix and range query problems

---

## Phase 8: Heaps & Priority Queues (Weeks 19-20)

### Topics  
- Binary heap properties and implementations  
- Min-heap and max-heap  
- Applications: heap sort, priority queues, median finding

### Practice  
- Implement heap insert and extract operations  
- Solve problems involving dynamic median and priority scheduling

---

## Phase 9: Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) (Weeks 21)

### Topics  
- Concept of disjoint sets  
- Union and Find operations  
- Path compression and union by rank optimizations  
- Applications in Kruskalâ€™s MST, cycle detection

### Practice  
- Implement union-find  
- Solve connectivity and clustering problems

---

## Phase 10: Practice & Real-World Applications (Ongoing)

### Activities  
- Implement data structures from scratch regularly  
- Solve mixed data structure problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)  
- Use data structures in your projects (e.g., caching with hash maps, tree-based searches)  
- Study internal data structures of libraries/frameworks you use

# Tips for Success

- Always implement each data structure from scratch to understand internals  
- Practice operations (insert, delete, search) repeatedly  
- Understand trade-offs (when to use which DS)  
- Write clean and modular code  
- Use visual tools to understand complex structures (trees, graphs)  
- Solve related algorithm problems to reinforce understanding
