## 🎯 Tips to Master CP

- Focus on **understanding** not memorization  
- After every contest: **analyze mistakes**, learn from others  
- Don't jump to solutions—**struggle** for at least 30–45 minutes  
- Implement standard templates for DFS, Dijkstra, etc.  
- Use pen and paper to dry run logic  
- Aim for quality over quantity
